👋 Howdy, Fellow Code Wranglers!

I'm Matteo De Vellis, the mad scientist behind the keyboard and the proud commander of my very own home server fortress! 🏡💻

🤓 What I'm All About
By day, I'm a grocery store manager, but when the sun sets, I transform into the ultimate server guru. My home server isn't just a bunch of wires and blinking lights; it's the beating heart of my digital playground.

🚀 Home Server Shenanigans
🌐 Digital Mayor: My server is the mayor of my online town, hosting websites, sharing files, and basically keeping the internet vibes in my house alive.

🛡️ Guard Dog of Data: Security first! My server is like a loyal guard dog, protecting my data with barks of 3 backups on 2 mediums with 1 off site.

⚙️ Tech Toolbox
OS: Proxmox 8.1 (Debian 11 based Hypervisor)
Virtual Playpen: Ubuntu 23.10 based Proxmox LXCs for each application
Services Circus: Plex, Heimdall, Nginx, Crafty, MotionEye, FileBrowser/NAS etc. 
Networking Fiesta: 2.5G networking with separate virtual network bridges for each LXC
🚧 What's Cookin'
Currently, I'm whipping up a completely self-hosted, and more importantly OFFLINE, smart home. Expect a dash of code, a sprinkle of config files, and a whole lot of excitement!

🚀 Let's Geek Out Together
If you're into servers, tech, or just shooting the breeze, hit me up! I'm always up for a good chat, collaboration, or swapping tales of coding conquests.

Thanks for dropping by my digital corner! May your code compile on the first try, and your servers stay forever hiccup-free! 🚀✨
